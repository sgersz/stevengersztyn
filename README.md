# 👋 Hi, I'm Steven Gersztyn

🚀 Cloud Infrastructure & Security Engineer | AWS, Azure, Okta, GitHub | Mentor

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m passionate about building **secure, scalable, cloud-native systems** while making tech approachable for others. From managing AWS and Azure environments, to integrating SSO and identity platforms like Okta, to mentoring engineers in their cloud journey—I love solving problems at the intersection of **cloud, security, and people.**

## 🔍 What you’ll find here
- Infrastructure as Code projects (Terraform, CloudFormation, Azure Bicep)
- Identity and SSO integration examples
- Automation scripts (PowerShell, Bash, GitHub Actions)
- Cheat sheets & guides I’ve created to mentor others

More coming soon as I document and share what I’ve learned!
